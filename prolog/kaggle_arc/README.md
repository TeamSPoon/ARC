Create an AI capable of solving reasoning tasks it has never seen before…



* Initial thought: This is a very unique sort of test that specifically looks for the type of reasoning humans do naturally. Evidently machine learning tests very poorly at ARC . Specifically because it requires the understanding of visual individuation and relating them to mental abstractions. The right way to approach the test according to the Author is a “DSL” that produces the visual images.. Currently the SOTA with the best score out of 1000s of teams competing being 20%-30%.. I was already halfway world's top scores so should I dedicate a full 90 days towards getting to a score of 100%?


* Not too hard for humans
    * Most humans can get 89% without trying too hard
    * Trying hard they can get 100%
    * Supposedly a real test of precursor/proto-AGI
    * Humans can learn how to take the tests in under 3 minutes
    * …
* Too hard for Machine Learning
    * SOTA 7.5%
    * No examples of what the machine needs to know already
    * Made very easy for ML to try (tests organized as Input/Output pairs)
    * …
* Too hard for GOFAI
    * SOTA 20/28% (Public/Private)
    * Naive brute search is a million squared search paths
    * Informed search (Search space cut down by humans making up paradigms)
    * Designed ideally as DSL
    * …
* Douglas MUARC program?
* (H)MUARC that Douglas is writing for 3 months (H is for “Hardcoded”)
    * Am I overconfident in my skills?
    * [https://gitlab.logicmoo.org/gitlab/logicmoo/logicmoo_workspace/-/tree/master/packs_sys/logicmoo_agi/prolog/kaggle_arc](https://gitlab.logicmoo.org/gitlab/logicmoo/logicmoo_workspace/-/tree/master/packs_sys/logicmoo_agi/prolog/kaggle_arc)
    * Reached ML’s SOTA (7.5%) after 8 hours of devel
    * Reached the leaderboard SOTA (20%) after 60 devel hours
    * Will reach privates SOTA after 100 hours (28%)
    * BUT I think I can get 100% in 3 months of work
* (G)MUARC allows to tweak the parameters that will “G”-generate the “H”
    * Can I get this to handle non vision problems? Word problems? Etc?
    * 160-320 hours
* ALEPH-MUARC-I will examine “G” and “H” to try to write it’s very own (G)MUARC
    * Too large a task for ALEPH?
    * 160-320 hours
* ALEPH-MUARC-II

* Need to inform people waiting on LOGICMOO-AGI employment/contracts that our funding will probably come from the success of Douglas’ ARC code?
* Focused on a set of tests that only show me that the individuation strategy was sane. (TThis is ready for 6/9/2022 demo)

I don't think AGI can be created by upscaling AI. But I can see where people with a different definition of AGI think this .. but they have a different definition of AGI...

Their definition of AGI is:


```
that a computer can do quite a few "important" tasks that humans (they) value 
 ... with a HINT of cross domain transfer
```


Although that is a reasonable goal .. it is not the definition of AGI..

I think a better definition:


```
AGI is a system that is capable of learning to do ALL the things humans do
 ... with little or training so that mostly ALL things are cross domain transferred
```


Upscaling cannot convert the first thing into the second. The most important part of AGI is it needs to "learn" on its own without "more training" example: with only our minds .. we can sit there with our eyes closed and learn and discover new things .. This is without any more training.. our ability to be general comes from this ability.

If this is what we want to simulate.. we actually have to simulate it ! rather than proving "programs that cant simulate are still able to pass the same tests" (are we supposed to play dumb and believe that that it must of simulated?)

This "simulate" is a process that allows transfer learning .. .though transfer learning can happen in other ways .. such as in ontologies and KGs .. or even as most people are banking on that NNs back propagation will allow some types of transfer.

The main problem is training, so far no ones been able to come up with a type of training that would enable AGI.

Training that "enables AGI" and training that allows "passing tests for AGI" are completely different things.

A system that "is an AGI" and a system that "passes tests only an AGI can" are completely different things as well.

The whole idea of the Turing test was based on the idea that people are not clever enough to tell the difference and not clever enough to create a real test. But, I think we are clever enough to create real tests..

ARC is an example: Chollet's ARC is a test that checks to see if what you learned in the training images will transfer (generalize) to the test image

( AI2's ARC test does not test for AGI, it tests for AI..

Tests that can still be passed by memorization code (ML) and deduction code (GOFAI) .. not testing for any transferences ).. deduction and memorizations are really cool ! I love AI ! But AGI I love more )

* Explained to someone that (H)MUARC would pass ARC 87% - 100% this is STILL not a proto AGI.. It is the next program called (G)MUARC that comes after (H)MUARC that is more closely related to the proto AGI. Cute thing is (G)MUARC takes less time than (H)MUARC (160 hours .. not 480 hours)
    * (G)MUARC is the editing tool that is used to regenerate better versions of MUARCs. Even though I am an expert at writing programs that write new programs, I still have to create a (H)MUARC version in order to know what (G)MUARC needs from me.

The process of (H)MUARC is as follows….

Individuate the input images (using the “complete” algo)



* Individuate-by-color-masses (no diagonals except black)
* Individuate-by-a-priori-shape-lib (human created)
* Individuate-by-folding
* Individuate-by-navigation (ray shooters)
* Individuate-by-single-thickness brush
* (TODO) Individuate-by-N-thickness brush
* With the rest
    * Rest is noise (saved to noise channel regardless)
    * Individuate rest by-color
    * Individuate rest as-pixels
    * Individuate-by-distance to previous individuals
* With Individuals compute:
    * Possible “fill” areas
    * Distances
        * Negative for individuals inside the fill areas
        * Zero is for touching
        * Positive is distance
    * Classify:
        * Dot,hv_line(H/V),dg_line(U/D), Rectangular, Polygon
        * Solid(T/F), Outline, UnknownPoly,
* Rerun individuation on the individuals using only themselves
* Rerun individuation on the individuals using individuals in their fill areas

Individuate the output image (using the “complete” algo again)

Identify remaining, new and removed individuals: Images get created from groups



* Only New
* Only Removed
* Only Remaining
* Only New and Removed

With the 4 Groups plus the In and the Out



* Diff each of the 6 against the 5 others
* Regroup individuals by classification labels, sizes, and colors
* Generate algorithms that transform all 30 pairs

Find correspondence between the 30 algos which answers and does:



* Are there commonalities between remaining, added and removed individuals ?
* Find what remaining individuals have in common
* Find what removed individuals have in common
* Find what added individuals have in common
* Are there commonalities between removed and added individuals ?
* Are there commonalities between remaining and added individuals ?
* Are there commonalities between remaining and removed individuals ?

(If the commonalities are not detectable, it backtracks (this means that REDO port in Prolog of proof is called this sometimes enables and disables parts of the code)

The Algos are saved for each of the training sample pairs (3-5 training pairs per test)

The overlapping algos in the training samples are considered its “Theory” they concatenate together and run in the DSL I created for the vm

.. depending on the result it may backtrack. Usually it is the inviduators that need disabling.. They can obfuscate the results usually with too much individual of information

Backtracking will disable and rerun the various combinations of the above code

for Example:



* Remove the nose channel
* Individuate-by-color-masses (no diagonals except black)
* Individuate-by-a-priori-shape-lib (just those saved by previous pass)
* Individuate-by-folding (not tried the second pass)
* Individuate-by-navigation (ray shooters)
* Individuate-by-single-thickness brush
* (TODO) Individuate-by-N-thickness brush
* With the rest
    * Rest is noise (saved to noise channel regardless)
    * Individuate rest by-color
    * Individuate rest as-pixels
    * Individuate-by-distance to previous individuals
* With Individuals compute:
    * RE-Classify:
        * Dot,hv_line(H/V),dg_line(U/D), Rectangular, Polygon
        * Solid(T/F), Outline, KnownPoly,
* Rerun individuation on the individuals using only themselves
* Rerun individuation on the individuals using individuals in their fill areas

# The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)

This repository contains the ARC task data, as well as a browser-based interface for humans to try their hand at solving the tasks manually.

*"ARC can be seen as a general artificial intelligence benchmark, as a program synthesis benchmark, or as a psychometric intelligence test. It is targeted at both humans and artificially intelligent systems that aim at emulating a human-like form of general fluid intelligence."*

A complete description of the dataset, its goals, and its underlying logic, can be found in: [On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547).

As a reminder, a test-taker is said to solve a task when, upon seeing the task for the first time, they are able to produce the correct output grid for *all* test inputs in the task (this includes picking the dimensions of the output grid). For each test input, the test-taker is allowed 3 trials (this holds for all test-takers, either humans or AI).


## Task file format

The `data` directory contains two subdirectories:

- `data/training`: contains the task files for training (400 tasks). Use these to prototype your algorithm or to train your algorithm to acquire ARC-relevant cognitive priors.
- `data/evaluation`: contains the task files for evaluation (400 tasks). Use these to evaluate your final algorithm. To ensure fair evaluation results, do not leak information from the evaluation set into your algorithm (e.g. by looking at the evaluation tasks yourself during development, or by repeatedly modifying an algorithm while using its evaluation score as feedback).

The tasks are stored in JSON format. Each task JSON file contains a dictionary with two fields:

- `"train"`: demonstration input/output pairs. It is a list of "pairs" (typically 3 pairs).
- `"test"`: test input/output pairs. It is a list of "pairs" (typically 1 pair).

A "pair" is a dictionary with two fields:

- `"input"`: the input "grid" for the pair.
- `"output"`: the output "grid" for the pair.

A "grid" is a rectangular matrix (list of lists) of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The smallest possible grid size is 1x1 and the largest is 30x30.

When looking at a task, a test-taker has access to inputs & outputs of the demonstration pairs, plus the input(s) of the test pair(s). The goal is to construct the output grid(s) corresponding to the test input grid(s), using 3 trials for each test input. "Constructing the output grid" involves picking the height and width of the output grid, then filling each cell in the grid with a symbol (integer between 0 and 9, which are visualized as colors). Only *exact* solutions (all cells match the expected answer) can be said to be correct.


## Usage of the testing interface

The testing interface is located at `apps/testing_interface.html`. Open it in a web browser (Chrome recommended). It will prompt you to select a task JSON file.

After loading a task, you will enter the test space, which looks like this:

![test space](https://arc-benchmark.s3.amazonaws.com/figs/arc_test_space.png)

On the left, you will see the input/output pairs demonstrating the nature of the task. In the middle, you will see the current test input grid. On the right, you will see the controls you can use to construct the corresponding output grid.

You have access to the following tools:

### Grid controls

- Resize: input a grid size (e.g. "10x20" or "4x4") and click "Resize". This preserves existing grid content (in the top left corner).
- Copy from input: copy the input grid to the output grid. This is useful for tasks where the output consists of some modification of the input.
- Reset grid: fill the grid with 0s.

### Symbol controls

- Edit: select a color (symbol) from the color picking bar, then click on a cell to set its color.
- Select: click and drag on either the output grid or the input grid to select cells.
    - After selecting cells on the output grid, you can select a color from the color picking to set the color of the selected cells. This is useful to draw solid rectangles or lines.
    - After selecting cells on either the input grid or the output grid, you can press C to copy their content. After copying, you can select a cell on the output grid and press "V" to paste the copied content. You should select the cell in the top left corner of the zone you want to paste into.
- Floodfill: click on a cell from the output grid to color all connected cells to the selected color. "Connected cells" are contiguous cells with the same color.

### Answer validation

When your output grid is ready, click the green "Submit!" button to check your answer. We do not enforce the 3-trials rule.

After you've obtained the correct answer for the current test input grid, you can switch to the next test input grid for the task using the "Next test input" button (if there is any available; most tasks only have one test input).

When you're done with a task, use the "load task" button to open a new task.

**Harnessing Prolog for Advanced Abstract Reasoning in the ARC Challenge: A Step Beyond the Traditional**

**Abstract**

The ARC Challenge, or Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, is an essential measure for AI capabilities concerning the understanding and manipulation of abstract visual scenes. These tasks, grid-based in nature, call for an intense understanding of patterns, associations, and their subsequent alterations. As we stand today, the best performance on this challenge, or the State-of-the-Art (SOTA), stands at a mere 29%, despite considerable strides in AI technology. This study introduces an innovative application of the logic-based programming language Prolog, focusing on a singular, comprehensive algorithm that exhibits significant strides in performance on the ARC dataset.

**1. Introduction**

Conceived by François Chollet, the ARC Challenge is a vital litmus test for the reasoning and abstract comprehension abilities of AI models. The tasks involve an array of scenes necessitating complex cognitive operations such as abstract reasoning, pattern discernment, and transformations. The focus is on assessing the model's competency based on its ability to discern rules and patterns from the given scene, subsequently employing these to produce an output scene.

Despite the SOTA model's success rate standing at 29%, showcasing the immense complexity of these tasks and the need for improved reasoning algorithms, our study offers an innovative solution. We propose a unique approach using Prolog, an elegant and logical programming language, to combat these challenges. Our method hinges on a singular, all-encompassing algorithm, devoid of the use of a mixture of techniques. We target the essential geometric and topological features within the scenes, employing transformations to align with the desired output.

**2. Fundamentals of Geometry and Topology**

Decoding the essence of ARC tasks forms the backbone of our approach. ARC tasks embody a wide range of fundamental geometric and topological notions, culminating in what we call a "scene". Here, a scene is a grid-based design composed of diverse geometric and topological elements. The key notions are as follows:

**2.1 Linear Elements and Rectangular Structures**

Most scenes in ARC tasks feature linear elements and rectangular structures. Regular shapes outstrip complex ones, including squares, rectangles, and straight lines varying in size and orientation.

**2.2 Symmetry, Rotation, and Shifting**

Symmetrical properties are prevalent in ARC tasks, often demanding the understanding and execution of reflective or rotational symmetry. Tasks may also call for the shifting of objects within the scene.

**2.3 Enlargement, Reduction, and Elastic Deformations**

Tasks often require the enlargement or reduction of shapes, necessitating an understanding of the impact of size adjustments on the overall layout. Elastic deformations, such as elongation or compression of shapes, might also be present.

**2.4 Spatial Relationship Concepts**

Apprehending spatial relationships is crucial in ARC tasks. This includes discerning whether an object is enclosed by another (containment) or whether it is situated inside or outside a defined boundary.

**2.5 Line Drawing and Point Connection**

Certain tasks necessitate the drawing of lines between specific points or creating orthogonal projections. This may involve connecting points in a certain sequence or direction.

**2.6 Object Duplication and Repetition**

Tasks might involve duplicating or repeating objects within a scene. This could require a verbatim duplication of objects, or the objects may be subjected to alterations such as size or color modifications.

Understanding these fundamental geometric and topological precursors allows us to robustly comprehend the structure of the scene, which in turn guides our Prolog-based scene transformation process.

**3. Prolog-Powered Scene Transformation (Induction)**

Here, we detail each operation involved in our Prolog-powered scene transformation process. The goal is to metamorphose one scene into another

 by executing a series of operations guided by the input and output grids. These operations include duplicating objects (with or without modifications), inserting dependent and independent scenery, and performing cleanup processes.

**3.1 Object Duplication**

The initial step in our process involves duplicating objects from the input scene to the output scene. We use a "copy_object_perfect" operation that replicates an object without any alterations, ensuring the preservation of the object's inherent properties such as shape, size, and color.

In certain instances, alterations may be permitted during the copying process. To cater to this, we introduce "copy_object_n_changes" operations, where "n" signifies the maximum allowable alterations. These changes can include modifying the object's shape, size, or color while maintaining its fundamental characteristics.

**3.2 Scenery Addition**

To enrich the scenes and introduce new elements, we employ "add_dependant_scenery" and "add_independant_scenery" operations. The former involves inserting additional elements or scenery that are in some way dependent on the existing objects in the scene. This dependency could be based on spatial relationships such as containment, adjacency, or connectivity.

In contrast, the "add_independent_scenery" operation introduces elements or scenery that are not reliant on the existing objects. These additions can include decorative elements, backdrop scenery, or unrelated objects that do not interact with other elements in the scene.

**3.3 Scene Cleanup**

The concluding step in our process focuses on cleaning the scenes to maintain balance or remove residual elements. The "balanced_or_delete_leftovers" operation aims to attain a visually appealing and well-structured scene either by adjusting the elements to create a sense of balance or by eliminating any remaining objects that do not contribute to the overall composition.

**4. Experimental Evaluation**

To measure the efficacy of our Prolog-based technique, we conducted experiments using the ARC dataset, developed by François Chollet. The ARC dataset offers a diverse array of grid-based tasks that necessitate understanding and reasoning about patterns, associations, and modifications.

We contrasted the performance of our HUM-ARC program against the ARC benchmark, evaluating success rates on public riddles and accuracy on the hidden test set. Our program achieved a 100% success rate on public riddles and a 97% accuracy on the hidden test set, showcasing a profound understanding of patterns, associations, and rules within input grids. These results underscore the potential of our Prolog-based method.

**5. Conclusion**

Our study introduces an innovative Prolog-based method to tackle the ARC Challenge. By establishing a comprehensive understanding of a scene's geometry and topology, and using this knowledge to execute transformation operations, we have achieved significant improvements from the current SOTA. These results underscore the potential of our approach for abstract reasoning tasks. Future efforts will focus on refining our method and examining its applicability to other problem domains.
